The objective of Otto Group Product Classification Challenge is to build a model which is able to distinguish between 9 categories provided.
The dataset is organized in folders containing training and testing data for products selected randomly.
The training set is comprised of 61.878 labeled products (Class_1, Class_2, ..., Class_9) and have 93 numerical features ranging from 0 to 352.
Our work is to predict 144.368 products of the testing dataset (test.csv) in the format predefined (sampleSubmission.csv).
The four different approaches-algorithms are used for this task and their results are compared.
